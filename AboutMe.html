    <h1>About Me!</h1>
    <p style="width: 400px">Hi everyone. I'm a young forty-something year old, who has always had a passion for learning.  I enjoy crafting, writing, and geeking out over science, video games, and epic movie trilogies.  I love animals, nature, and family. I'm a pretty mellow and laid back guy, not to be confused with lazy, in fact quite the opposite, I'm a hard worker who always gives 100 percent, and who takes pride in his work and finding solutions to an assortment of problems.  I'm a team player, I don't strive for leadership, but I'm more than happy to take the lead when needed. I'm an upbeat and positive thinker, who believes in people, oftentimes even more than they believe in themselves. So lets join heads and build a better future, for ourselves, for our friends and family, and for future generations. </p>
